### Float

**Endpoint:** `GET /stocks/vX/float`

**Description:**

Retrieve the latest free float for a specified stock ticker. Free float represents the shares outstanding that are considered available for public trading, after accounting for shares held by strategic or long-term holders.

Shares held by founders, officers and directors, employees, controlling shareholders, affiliated companies, private equity and venture capital firms, sovereign wealth funds, government entities, employee plans, trusts, restricted or locked-up holdings, and any shareholder owning 5% or more of total issued shares are not treated as part of the tradable supply. Shares held by pension funds, mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds without board representation, depositary banks, and other broadly diversified investors are generally treated as part of the public free float.

Free float reflects a stock’s effective tradable supply and is a key input for assessing liquidity, volatility, market impact, and ownership structure. Figures may reflect ownership changes with a reporting lag, since they are based on publicly available disclosures and ownership information rather than real-time trading activity.

Use cases: liquidity analysis, volatility modeling, position sizing, market impact estimation, and ownership structure analysis.
