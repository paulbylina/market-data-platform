### Short Interest

**Endpoint:** `GET /stocks/v1/short-interest`

High short interest can signal bearish sentiment or highlight opportunities such as potential short squeezes. This endpoint provides essential insights for investors monitoring market positioning and sentiment.

Use Cases: Market sentiment analysis, short-squeeze prediction, risk management, trading strategy refinement.
